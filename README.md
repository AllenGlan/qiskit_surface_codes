# Qiskit Surface Code Encoder/Decoder
## IBM Qiskit - Summer Jam Hackathon 2020

Quantum computation is an inherently noisy process. Scalable quantum computers will require fault-tolerance to implement useful computation. There are many proposed approaches to this, but one promising candidate is the family of *topological quantum error correcting codes*.

Currently, the [`qiskit.ignis.verification.topological_codes`](https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/verification.html#topological-codes) module provides a general framework for QEC and implements one specific example, the *repetition code*.

For the hackathon, our team, [Erwin's Tigers](#team), implemented a full **surface code encoder and decoder** for Qiskit Ignis. We hope that this implementation will be useful to other Qiskitters and will inspire others to continue building out the `topological_codes` module into a diverse family.

## Background

Surface codes are a type of CSS code, consisting of pairwise commuting X and Z stabilizers made of Pauli gates. It defines a logical state on a 2 by 2 lattice made of quantum bits with the stabilizers X<sub>1</sub> X<sub>2</sub> Z<sub>1</sub> Z<sub>2</sub>.

The code is based on the earlier theoretical idea of a *toric code*, with periodic boundary conditions instead of open boundary conditions. This has been shown to be largely identical, but embedding a surface code on an actual device is much easier.

## Implementation

In general, we try to follow the existing structure of [`qiskit.ignis.verification.topological_codes`](https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/verification.html#topological-codes). The code is implemented separately here but is able to easily be merged into Ignis.

There are two main interfaces â€” corresponding to the encoder and decoder, respectively:

### `SurfaceCode` in [`surface_code.circuits`](surface_code/circuits.py)

`SurfaceCode(d, T)` generates a `QuantumCircuit` for creating a logical state and measuring stabilizers. The class is parameterized with the code distance `d` (which should be odd) and the number of syndrome measurement rounds `T` (usually `T = d`). This class also handles parsing of the physical device readout into a form suitable for decoding. Please see the [encoder tutorial]() for a full walkthrough.

</p>

### `GraphDecoder` in [`surface_code.fitters`](surface_code/fitters.py)

`GraphDecoder(d, T)` implements minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) on the syndrome measurements of the physical circuit. The parsed readout from the device is used to generate graphs of *error chains*, which decode syndrome measurements into the most likely sequence of qubit flips over time. Please see the [decoder tutorial]() for a full walkthrough.
